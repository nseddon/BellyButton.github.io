## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to build a webpage for users to interact with belly button bacteria data.  The raw data is read from a .json file provided by the client.  The user will select a test id from a dropdown menu provided, in order to see the data correlating to that test participant.  Use of a Github Page was necessary to host the study findings online for access.
